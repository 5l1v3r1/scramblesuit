0. Preliminaries

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. Overview

    ScrambleSuit is a pluggable transport protocol for the obfsproxy
    obfuscation framework [XXX].  Its entire payload is computationally
    indistinguishable from randomness, it modifies its flow signature to foil
    simple statistical classifiers and it handles authenticated encryption for
    the transported protocol.

    For the motivation, a protocol overview, the threat model and evaluation,
    please read the original research paper discussing ScrambleSuit [XXX].
    This protocol specification discusses a subset of the research paper in
    greater detail to facilitate alternative implementations of the protocol.
    Besides, this specification is intended to be updated if necessary whereas
    the research paper will remain as is.

TODO:
    - Byte order
    - Clarify operators (e.g., concatenation)

2.  Authentication

    There exist two ways for a client to authenticate itself towards a
    ScrambleSuit server.  First, by redeeming a session ticket.  Second, by
    conducting a UniformDH handshake.  While a valid session ticket might not
    always be available, a client is always able to conduct a UniformDH
    handshake.  Both authentication mechanisms rely on a previously shared
    secret without which authentication cannot succeed.  This should thwart
    active probing attacks.

2.1 UniformDH Handshake

    A client can authenticate itself towards a ScrambleSuit server by
    conducting a UniformDH handshake.  UniformDH was originally proposed in the
    obfs3 protocol specification [XXX].  ScrambleSuit uses obfs3's UniformDH
    handshake with the single exception that it employs the 4096-bit MODP group
    number 16 as defined in RFC 3526 instead of the 1536-bit group used in
    obfs3.  The reason for that is for our protocol to achieve a security level
    of at least 128 bits of symmetric security as defined by ECRYPT [XXX].
    Note that in order for a UniformDH handshake to succeed, both parties share
    a 160-bit secret k_B which is exchanged out-of-band over Tor's BridgeDB
    component.  ScrambleSuit bridges automatically publish their k_B key.

    A UniformDH handshake consists of two messages: one from the client to the
    server and one from the server to the client.  The diagram below
    illustrates the handshake.  After the randomly chosen 512-byte public key
    X, random padding P_C is appended.  The length of the padding must be
    uniformly chosen from {0..988} bytes.  After the padding, a 16-byte mark
    M_C is appended which is defined as:

      M = HMAC-SHA256-128(k_B, X)

    The mark is used to easily locate the MAC which is the last element of the
    client's handshake message.  The 16-byte MAC is defined as:

      MAC = HMAC-SHA256-128(k_B, X | P_C | E)

    The variable E is a string representation of the current Unix epoch divided
    by 3600.  It represents the amount of hours passed since the epoch.  It is
    used by the client and the server to prove liveness.  For example, the Unix
    timestamp 1378768086 would map to E = 1378768086 / 3600 = "382991".

    The server's handshake message is created analogous to the client.

    After conducting UniformDH, a client and server agreed on a 512-byte random
    number.  This random number is then hashed using SHA256 to obtain the
    256-bit master key k_t.  Session keys are then derived from k_t as
    discussed in Section XXX.

    Client                              Server  Legend:
      |  X | P_C | M_C | MAC(X | P_C | E)  |    X: client public key
      | ---------------------------------> |    Y: server public key
      |  Y | P_S | M_S | MAC(X | P_S | E)  |    P_{C,S}: padding
      | <--------------------------------- |    M_{C,S}: mark to locate the MAC
      |         AEnc(k_t+1 | T_t+1)        |    E: approximate timestamp
      | <--------------------------------- |    k_t+1: future master key
      |          AEnc(Tor traffic)         |    T_t+1: future ticket
      | <--------------------------------> |

    Immediately after the handshake succeeded, the server proceeds to issue and
    send a new session ticket T_t+1 together with the according master key
    k_t+1.  Session tickets are discussed in Section 2.2.  This tuple can then
    be used by the client to authenticate itself the next time it connects to
    the server.  Afterwards the newly issued ticket, encrypted and
    authenticated Tor traffic is finally exchanged between the client and the
    server.

2.2 Session Ticket Handshake

    Alternatively to UniformDH, implementations SHOULD support session tickets.
    A client can authenticate itself towards a ScrambleSuit server by redeeming
    a 112-byte session ticket T.  Such a ticket contains the master key k_t and
    is encrypted by keys only known by the server.  The structure of a session
    ticket is discussed in Section XXX.  If a valid session ticket is
    available, a client SHOULD redeem it rather than conduct a UniformDH
    handshake.

    The handshake is a single message which the client sends to the server.
    The diagram below illustrates the handshake.  After the 112-byte session
    ticket, random padding P is appended.  The padding must be uniformly chosen
    from {0..1388} bytes.  After the padding, a 16-byte mark M
    is appended which is defined as:

      M = HMAC-SHA256-128(k_t, T)

    The mark is used to easily locate the MAC which is the last part of the
    handshake.  The MAC is defined as:

      MAC = HMAC-SHA256-128(k_t, T | P | E)

    The variable E is a string representation of the current Unix epoch divided
    by 3600.  It represents the amount of hours passed since the epoch.  It is
    used by the client and the server to prove liveness.  For example, the Unix
    timestamp 1378768086 would map to E = 1378768086 / 3600 = "382991".

    Client                         Server  Legend:
      |  T | P | M | MAC(T | P | E)  |     T: session ticket
      | ---------------------------> |     P: random padding
      |      AEnc(k_t+1 | T_t+1)     |     M: mark to locate the MAC
      | <--------------------------- |     E: approximate timestamp
      |       AEnc(Tor traffic)      |     k_t+1: future master key
      | <--------------------------> |     T_t+1: future ticket

    The server is initially unable to distinguish between a session ticket
    handshake and a UniformDH handshake since both handshakes are
    computationally indistinguishable from randomness.  Therefore, it first
    tries to opportunistically decrypt the session ticket T after verifying its
    MAC first.  If the MAC is valid and the ticket can be decrypted and is not
    yet expired, the server then verifies the MAC which is built over T | P |
    E.  If this MAC is valid, the handshake succeeded.  The server then
    proceeds to derive session keys as described in Section XXX.

    After a ticket handshake succeeded, the server replies by issuing a new
    session ticket T_t+1 together with the according master key k_t+1.  The
    tuple can then be used by the client to authenticate itself the next time.

    Finally, both parties share the same 256-bit master key k_t from which
    session keys are then derived as discussed in Section XXX.  Afterwards,
    data can be exchanged which is authenticated and encrypted.

X. Key Derivation

   After authenticating either by redeeming a ticket or by running UniformDH, a
   client and server will have a shared 256-bit master key.  Overall, 144 bytes
   of key material is derived from the master key using HKDF based on SHA256.
   For expansion, the master key is used as HKDF's PRK and the empty string as
   HKDF's "info" argument.

   The 144-byte output is used as follows.  The byte offsets are in decimal.

     Bytes 000:031 - 256-bit AES-CTR session key to send data.
     Bytes 032:039 - 64-bit AES-CTR IV to send data.
     Bytes 040:071 - 256-bit AES-CTR session key to receive data.
     Bytes 072:079 - 64-bit AES-CTR IV to receive data.
     Bytes 080:111 - 256-bit HMAC-SHA256-128 key to send data.
     Bytes 112:143 - 256-bit HMAC-SHA256-128 key to receive data.

X. Header Format

   ScrambleSuit defines a 21-byte message header which contains the transported
   data.  The format of the header is depicted below.

   +----------+------------+--------------+--------+------------+------------+
   | 16 bytes |   2 bytes  |  2 bytes     | 1 byte | (optional) | (optional) |
   |   MAC    | Total len. | Payload len. | Flags  |  Payload   |  Padding   |
   +----------+------------+--------------+--------+------------+------------+
   \_ Plain _/ \____________  Encrypted and authenticated __________________/

   The 16-byte MAC refers to HMAC-SHA256-128 which is keyed by a dedicated and
   shared HMAC key.  The MAC authenticates the remainder of the message.  In
   accordance with the encrypt-then-MAC principle, the MAC is calculated after
   the remainder of the message is already encrypted.

   The 2-byte total length refers to the overall length of the message
   excluding the header whereas the 2-byte payload length refers to the payload
   only.  The difference between total length and payload length is padding
   which is used for packet length obfuscation.  Note that both fields can be
   set to 0 which results in an empty protocol message.  ScrambleSuit's maximum
   message length is 1448 bytes.  Exluding the header, this results in 1437
   bytes for the transported data.

   The 1-byte flag field is used for protocol signaling.  Below, all defined
   flags along with their semantics are explained.

   Flag name       | Bit # | Description
   ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------
   FLAG_PAYLOAD    |   1   | Application data.
   FLAG_NEW_TICKET |   2   | Newly issued session ticket and master key.
   FLAG_PRNG_SEED  |   3   | PRNG seed to derive obfuscation distributions.

   Finally, a ScrambleSuit message contains the transported data which is
   followed by padding.  Padding MUST always be discarded when a protocol
   message is processed.  Since padding is always encrypted, client and server
   MAY simply pad with 0 bytes.

   When ScrambleSuit protocol messages are received, the receiver first MUST
   validate the MAC.  If the MAC is invalid, the connection MUST be terminated
   immediately.

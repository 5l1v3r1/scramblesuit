ScrambleSuit is a pluggable transport protocol for obfsproxy.  It is written in
pure Python and solves two problems:
- Protection against active probing attacks by requiring a shared secret
  between the client and the server.
- Rudimentary defence against traffic analysis attacks by altering flow
  features.

For the detailed design of ScrambleSuit, please have a look at the project
page which also contains a link to the design paper:
